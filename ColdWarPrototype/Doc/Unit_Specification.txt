    can move depending on the type.

2.) There are different types of units, which represent general movement
    behaviour.

     units can move between neighboring ground provinces. They can be
	 strategically redeployed to move to toher continents.

2.2) Air: These units represent air squadrons, which are based in one
     ground province or a water province with a carrier group. They can
	 fly missions within their action radius. They can be strategically
	 redeployed to rebase them to a different province.
	 ICBMs are special air units which can avoid interception by air units.

2.3) Naval: These units are fleets composed of ships, which move freely
     between water provinces and can be moved into coastal ground provinces.
	 Special ships are carriers, which act as a mobile air base. Submarines

	 fleets or borders.
